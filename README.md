# Jackie (Reporting Service)
This repository contains a small web application written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) with [Nickel](https://github.com/nickel-org/nickel.rs) that allows for browsing of events queried from [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com/). In particular, events can be browsed through their correlation and consistency relationships to other events.

## How to run
This application can be run using `cargo run`.
